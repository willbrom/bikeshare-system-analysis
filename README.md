# bikeshare-system-analysis

Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle- sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles for short trips, typically 30 minutes or less. Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

This project uses a sample of this data to analysis the system.
